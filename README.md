## Agile
* [Add a new issue](../../issues/new) for each task.
* Tag [issues](../../issues) with [todo](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Atodo), [doing](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adoing), [done](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adone) (and [backlog](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abacklog)).
* Update tags once a week, to keep track of who does what.

## Team
