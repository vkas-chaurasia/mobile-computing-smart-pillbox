# Prompts
The "AI" tool prompts used in this project.

> Note: it is absolutely fine, not to use "AI" tools at all.

### Save prompts or entire sessions
- Download your "AI" tool prompts or session logs into this _prompts_ directory
- Rename the file to include a UTC timestamp, e.g. 2025-08-29T09-45-00Z.txt

### Mark code as based on a prompt
To attribute "AI" tool use in a source file, for transparency and academic integrity.
